The following .c files include the software thats needed to interact and controll the following hardware: TM4C123GH6PM 
microcontroller, two stepper motor drivers , and bluetooth module.
Aside from the above, there is also  .c files demonstrating how to calculate the azimuth and altitude angles needed by the table top telescope and whose values are used in determing the amount of steps needed to be done by the two stepper motors that control the base(mount) and optical tube.

In the pdf file in the main directory there is a break down of the technologies used in this project and also the development
of other software used in this project that is not included in this repository.
